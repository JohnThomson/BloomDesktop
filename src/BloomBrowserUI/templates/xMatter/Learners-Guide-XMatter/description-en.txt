[V3]Designed for Roger VanOtterloo's Learner's Guide books, this currently hard-codes a particular cover picture.
That supports a trick for wrapping text around a curve within it.
Not sure how/if this will generalize to several such books with different pictures.
For now this is just an experiment.
